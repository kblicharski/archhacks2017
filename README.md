# DiaMetrics

A way to receive heath insights from diabetes data

## What is it?

DiaMetrics takes the day-to-day data from a diabetic's life and puts it into a human-friendly format, making it visually pleasing as well as showing more information than raw data would. 
It gives helpful instructions based on blood-glucose level to help keep it in a healthy state.
