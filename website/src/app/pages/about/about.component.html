    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>DiaMetrics is an Angular web application meant to improve diabetes healthcare outcomes.
      DiaMetrics takes the data from a diabetic's life and plots the glucose levels against time throughout the day.
      It lists only the past 24 hours worth of data as to only contain relevant information. Calculations are also done
      based on the food consumed, as the ratio of the carbohydrates and insulin are exponentially weighted through time in a moving average.
      This average weights relevant information more and depicts a proper insulin to glucose level ratio.

            <span>I knew the most about Angular, so I wrote most of the website you are seeing now. The most
              challenging part was styling -- my background is mostly in backend development, and the transition
              to frontend has been both difficult and rewarding.</span>

          <span>I applied numerical statistics to develop the algorithm that checks the ratio of glucose to
          carbohydrates through an exponentially weighted moving average calculation. I also did not have previous
          web development experience, so learning Angular and embedding a Highcharts chart was also of relevance
          to me in this project. </span>
